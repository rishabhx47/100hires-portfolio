Cloud Code plus Karpathy are about to
destroy every lead gen agency in the
next 12 months, including ours, and I'm
going to show you exactly what I mean.
We have over 50 customers generating
anywhere from 200 to 300 positive
responses per day, and we had an
enterprise customer that we presented
the strategy to, and it doubled their
reply rates without us writing a single
email or manually uploading any leads to
any of their campaigns. So, in this
video, I'm going to go over what we did,
and by the end, I'm going to give away
the repository so you can install this
for your own business as well, too. So,
before we get into the actual meat and
potatoes of everything that we did, I
thought we would first go over the
results. I used the SmartLead API to
pull the reply rates, and as you can
see, between April 6th to 17th, our
automatic campaigns produced 20.71
replies per 1,000, and the other
campaigns produced 10.71 replies per
1,000, and then it stayed strong week
over week as well, too. So, our
automatic campaigns were getting this
reply rate, and then our other campaigns
were getting just around a 1% reply
rate, while into the second week when we
were still running, it still kept that
pace as well. So, it wasn't just a
little bit of a fluke. So, now that
you've seen the results, let's talk
about what we actually did here. Andre
Karpathy is a software engineer that
used to work at OpenAI, and from time to
time he comes out with these amazing
ideas, and he shares them as open-source
repositories. He created a repository he
called Auto Research that he was using
in order to train a small local model in
order to get some kind of computation
right that he wanted to be able to do
personally, and it basically ran an
experiment every 5 minutes to
self-improve itself, and it would run
experiments, figure out what worked, and
then keep progressing forward.
Basically, giving you machine learning
capabilities straight from your MacBook.
As soon as I heard about this, I
thought, "Oh my gosh, you know what the
number that we want to optimize for is
positive reply rate, we should install
this as well, too." And so then, we
presented this to this enterprise
customer who is totally game. And what
was funny is when we actually set it up
with Cloud Code, Cloud Code actually
threw away Karpathy's repository cuz it
wasn't actually necessary to use that.
It's just simply the idea of what we're
trying to achieve. That's the most
important part. And so, what we've done
is we've created a system that can read
through all of the past campaigns that
you've sent with the copywriting and
what were the leads and who were the
companies that we were targeting. And
then, it can look at who negatively
responded and who positively responded
and which campaigns had the highest
positive response rate so that it can
keep doing more of the thing that's
working and less of the things that
aren't working and doesn't require a
human to intervene and come up with all
of the new ideas. And so, if I were to
give you the repository right now, you
would actually be shocked at how much of
the auto research part it actually is.
And it's actually all about getting
context about your company. Because
without really good context, none of
this is going to matter. And so, this
visualization is just based off of all
the skills that we have based into the
repository and goes over what we need.
So, when you start this auto research
skill, you're first going to enter your
website and it's going to just learn
everything about your company and your
offer that it automatically can. So,
we'll enter their website in step one,
in step two, you'll do your auto
onboarding draft, and then for step
three, you're going to fill in some of
the gaps. And so, I would highly
recommend you go for a walk and you
start recording a voice memo and just
dump as much context about your dream
outbound campaigns and who your target
customer is. Take that transcript and
then give that transcript to Codex or
Claude Code or wherever you're going to
run this so it has an unbelievably great
amount of context about your company.
What it's then going to do is it's going
to create an ICP markdown file, it's
going to create a case study markdown
file, it's going to start getting a
value proposition markdown file, a
problem statement markdown file, and
start filling in those things so it now
has the context about your company, what
your customers care about, how you help
them, all those other things. After the
context, we have also found that pulling
your entire TAM is incredibly important
in order to run this process. Because
one mistake that we made when we were
first running this is we were letting
Claude try to make game time decisions
about, "Hey, I want to run an experiment
on companies that recently released a
new product. Let me go find companies
that recently founded a new product, and
let's run a campaign to that. And then,
it just would make decisions that
weren't really that great, and it
wouldn't get good coverage, and then
there weren't actually that many
companies that launched new products, so
then the sample size was small, and it
just it just didn't work. So, now what
we do is when we're taking customers
through this process internally, we
build the entire TAM with every
conceivable data point or qualitative
signal that you would want to know about
these companies, we just get it all done
up front. So, that when Claude Code or
Codex is reviewing all of the data for
the experiments that it can run, it
doesn't make any game time decisions.
All the data is just done, and it's
super easy with Claude Code and Codex to
keep this data updated on a monthly
basis, so that everything is fresh and
new. And here's an example we made for
another company. And as you can see,
what this company really cared about is
they wanted to target B2B SaaS
companies, but the main thing that they
wanted to know is, as you can see, this
is all just data that you'd be able to
get from Clay and their derived data
points. And then you see we have this
custom data right here, where we have
their demo booking CTA, the contact
sales CTA, the soft match, and the match
text, and all these things. This
company, it's really important for them
to know, does this company have a talk
to sales button, a get a demo button,
meet with somebody button, what is their
sales motion? This is the most important
thing for this customer. The second most
important thing is figuring out what is
this company's pricing. What's the
lowest pricing that they list on the
website, and what's the highest pricing
that they list on the website? Do they
have enterprise? Do they have a free
trial? And we got all of that data done
right here. The other thing that we did
is we don't necessarily have a use case
for this right now, but what if one day
we wanted to run an experiment where we
wanted to know, okay, what about
companies that had a sales leader, but
no sales individual contributors? Or
there was a lot of sales individual
contributors, but there was no sales
leader? Or there's a lot of marketing
leaders, but no individual contributors?
Or the ratio of all of them? So, we even
got how many sales leaders there are,
how many sales individual contributors
there are, how many leaders there are on
the marketing team, do they have a CRO,
do they have a VP of sales, do they have
a director of sales, do they have a CMO,
do they have a VP of marketing, do they
have a go-to-market engineer, are they
running meta ads, are they running
Google ads, do they have case studies
listed on their website, what case
studies do they mention, what's their
offer summary? We have all of this data
already put in here. And I just go over
all of this and to kind of just inundate
you with what's possible that what you
want to do when you set this up is just
get any data point you could reasonably
want to know about
done inside of Claude Code. To short cut
this, I think most of the data that we
used was with Rapid API, Apify, Prospeo,
Blitz API, and then that website
crawling that you saw, that was all done
with an open source library called HTML
to text to be able to find the keywords
about the book a meeting and all of
those other things. And then we used the
Batch API to do some AI processing with
GPT-5 Nano. The Apify MCP was also great
for finding the ads data and things like
that. All of these things are all in
easy Google search or just ask Claude
Code, "Hey, the data that I want to know
is this. What's a good data provider for
that?" And Claude Code is going to point
you in the right direction, for sure.
Now we've got everything. We have your
social proof, your context, the
companies in your TAM, what do they look
like, what are the different data
points, everything. And then that's when
Claude or Codex starts creating the
first round of experiments for us to
run. A lot of you might have heard the
saying, "The list is the message." It
will create campaigns based on, all
right, what are the cool data points
that we can find here that can uncover
some pain for us, what are some just
overall campaigns that share value
propositions that we should send. And so
it uses that underlying data with your
context and then suggest the campaigns
for you. After you approve the
experiments that you want it to run, it
will even say, "Hey, based on my
knowledge, this is an email that I would
send." I would say I spent no time
trying to perfect this email writing
thing because when we give this away for
free to everybody, you all are going to
have your own opinion on what a good
cold email looks like. So it's going to
give you a suggestion of what to send
based on the experiment and based on the
context, but it will also present you
with three to five contacts with all of
the information about the contacts and
the companies, so that you can write the
message, and then you don't have to
blame me for saying that the messaging
isn't good. Just write the message based
on if this is a VP of sales and they
have a demo button and they don't have a
sales team, this is what I would say.
And then you can build your own
messaging skill into the repository as
well, too. So, now we have all the
ingredients for an outbound campaign. We
have our company list, we have our
contact list, we have the context about
the sales offer that we're doing, and
then we have the experiments, and we
have the copywriting. Then it loads
everything into SmartLead and everything
into Instantly to be able to run the
first batch of campaigns. What I then
suggest you do is you use Codex in order
to They have an automation button and I
would run an automation every Friday to
use this repository to review the past
performance and help come up with the
next round of campaigns that we should
be trying. And then approve that
copywriting and then push it all in. You
could I am not even going to attempt to
release this internally. We have it
automatically making the campaigns and
then sending them. I am not even going
to attempt to release this for free and
make that the promise. You still will
have to see the next round of campaigns,
you'll see the insights from what you
learned in the last week, and then
you'll be able to make decisions on what
campaigns you're going to run next week.
It's not set to automatically run. I'm
sure you can just prompt it to
automatically run on your side as well,
but I just don't want to make that that
kind of promise. A couple of things that
I urge you not to change about the
repository is you want to make sure that
the CTA is locked. I have it in there
that one fear we had was when we set
this up for a customer, we would
accidentally come up with a campaign
where it would just give away the
software for free. We locked the CTA.
So, if you say, "I want to book
meetings," then it's going to be locked
to booking meetings. If you say you want
to give out a lead magnet or you have
some kind of offer of a lead magnet,
it's going to get locked to that. It
might come up with different ways to say
the CTA, but it's going to get locked
onto that CTA. And I think that's the
most important part. We already have in
in there that unless Million Verifier
has approved the email, it cannot be put
into Smart Lead. I showed you guys that
we put all the customers, companies, and
their TAM file into Superbase. For you,
it'll locally just run inside of a CSV
file so that you don't have to go crazy
and put it on the cloud or anything. And
then, we hard-coded in that it has user
approval as well. And then, it'll learn
every week. I would just say, "Hey,
Codex or Cloud Code, schedule this so
that it runs every week with a routine
on Cloud Code or an automation on
Codex." And then, [music] you'll get the
suggested next round of tests, and then
you'd be able to approve those and see
the copywriting and everything, and then
upload everything to Smart Lead with all
the contacts because it even will keep
track of who you reached out to and who
you haven't so that you can keep running
these new experiments and all this. I
personally think that this is going to
usher in the next era of marketing where
AI is kind of running these experiments
faster than a human would be able to.
The previous round of outbound that we
were just in was kind of this world of,
"Okay, now we can have as much data as
possible. Let's see all the crazy things
that we can do with it." But now, we're
going to give all the contacts and all
the data to AI, and AI will be able to
run way more variations than you'll ever
ever be able to run by yourself. And I I
personally think that this is the future
not only of outbound marketing, paid
media, organic and we're already seeing
it being done by other people as well,
too. If you are a B2B business owner
doing over $3 million in revenue and you
have a sales team that doesn't have
enough leads, and you don't want to
touch this, and you want a company to
install it for you, we always launch our
first campaign for somebody for free.
There's a link below in the video
description where you can apply to
launch your first campaign with us for
free. We'll use our infrastructure.
We'll pull the list. We'll do the
copywriting. We'll do everything for you
and validate that we can get you leads
before you ever sign a contract with us.
If you're interested in that, the link
is down below in the video description,
and I hope to see you there. Thanks for
watching.
