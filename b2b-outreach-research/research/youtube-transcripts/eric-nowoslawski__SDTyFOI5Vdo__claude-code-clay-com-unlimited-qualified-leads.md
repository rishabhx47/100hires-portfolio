Most people I speak to are still
generating leads the old-fashioned way.
They're going to one of the legacy tools
that aren't API first, downloading CSVs,
then they're maybe uploading that CSV to
get the leads validated, hoping that the
leads fit their ICP, maybe they're
automating those emails, and then
they're getting back whatever leads that
they possibly can. There's a new way to
generate leads that we install for all
of our customers that uses Claude code
and Clay to automatically pull all of
their ICP leads, score them, and then
push them into SmartLead so that we can
send all of our campaigns on autopilot,
including refilling them. In this video,
we're going to pull back the curtain on
one of my favorite customers, Pathos PR,
who we generate over 80 positive
responses per day for, and I'm going to
show you how we pull their entire list,
store it in Superbase, find the emails,
automatically push those emails to Clay,
score them with AI, and then push them
into SmartLead so that we can get this
awesome result for them, and then you
can maybe set that up for yourself. It's
kind of interesting cuz this campaign is
so high volume, but I'm just showing it
to you because it's extraordinary. This
is the same system we use for everyone,
even when we're generating five to 10
leads per day for our other customers as
well, too. [music] So, with the help of
the Pathos team, we helped develop the
system. I have to say, they know their
customer incredibly well. This would not
be possible without a great partnership
between their marketing team and our
technical team because I like to say
that we have the engine and we have the
rails to be able to send all of these
things and get it all done, but they
were tremendously helpful on the ICP
fit, the strategy, really knowing what
works, and all those kind of things.
This company is a PR company that helps
businesses increase their brand
awareness by getting them featured in
companies like Forbes, Business Insider,
and, you know, any other kind of
publication that you can talk about, and
they do everything for you, including
writing the article. And so, as you can
imagine, the amount of people who would
benefit from all of their industry
publications that they have networks
with is a really large TAM. This is why
we can send this many emails because
their TAM is this large, which then is
why we can generate that many positive
responses as well, too. So, let's go
into the workflow. Everything is
orchestrated with Claude code and Clay.
Let's first get into who Pathos is and
the proof of the results. So, anyone can
just say that they generate these leads
on behalf of their customers, but we
actually show it. We keep a Clay table
of every positive response we've ever
generated for them, and it shows in a
little bit over a year, we have
generated over 11,000 leads for this
customer. And actually, we get so many
leads, I wonder even if we refresh this,
I bet the count will go up. Yeah. See,
we even just got more leads while we
were just talking about this and I was
setting up the video. This is just proof
that we generate these leads. We've been
doing 80 positive responses per day over
the last couple months. We started off
at lower volume, but now, just to set
the expectations, we are sending tens of
thousands of emails every single day.
This is not a low volume campaign by any
means, but I can show you all the
orchestration of it right now. Now that
you've seen the proof, let's talk about
what it takes to actually put a campaign
of this scale on autopilot, whether
you're sending tens of thousand emails
per day or just hundreds of emails per
day. The principles still apply for
putting the campaigns on autopilot. One,
we need a programmatic way to be able to
pull our entire TAM and not rely on
keeping the TAM in some database and
then pulling CSVs. Two, we need to be
able to store it and then enrich all of
the valid email addresses right before
they get pushed into Clay so that we're
not doing all of our email finding
inside of Clay. We just found it to be a
little bit faster to do inside of
Superbase. Then, we need to use AI to
personalize the messaging because at
this scale especially, every single
person needs to be qualified and we need
to have one-to-one messaging written for
all of them. Then, we use Clay to push
all of those into Smart Lead so that
they'll automatically go into all of the
campaigns. I put together a little
diagram for us of exactly how we've put
this lead pipeline together and what
Claude code does along each side. And
so, first, all of this starts with list
sourcing. So, for this list, we first
got the leads from Prospeo and the Blitz
API. Prospeo just added some insane
filters to their database so that you
can do even better targeting, And I
really like working with the founders.
And then the Blitz API has an amazing,
almost all you can eat plan for finding
LinkedIn data that I highly recommend
when you're building these really large
bulk lists. And so first, we use Claude
Code to pull all of the contacts in the
filtered lists. It handles all of the
pagination, all of just the annoying
things that we're going to have happen.
And then, Claude Code even organizes
whether we got the contact from Blitz
API or Prospecto and dumps them into my
favorite database called Superbase.
Claude Code was even used to set up the
Superbase account that you are going to
see in a second as well, too, as far as
setting up the columns and doing what's
called indexing, so that we could query
these contacts extremely fast. Then,
while it's inside of Superbase, we do
our email enrichment in Superbase
because I always want to know how many
emails do we have loaded for this week
of the campaign. So, instead of waiting
until we send it over to Clay, we want
to find the valid emails inside of
Superbase. Claude Code also helped
orchestrate this because we wanted to
use our internal email database, which
has over 20 million emails inside of it.
Then we wanted to use the Smart Lead
Email Finder, which I highly recommend
because they're finding little emails
that other finders I see aren't finding.
Then we use the Prospecto API and then
ICPs, essentially building our own
waterfall inside of Superbase, but
Claude Code made it into an edge
function, so that it runs straight
inside of Superbase and it literally is
running every hour on every new contact
that we find inside of Superbase. All of
the validation for the emails still gets
validated by Million Verifier cuz we
just want to make sure that every single
email is always validated. And again,
Claude Code sets all of that up. And
now, here's the part where Claude Code
comes in with Clay. So, every morning,
we need to push the leads from Superbase
into Clay via webhook. So, we used
trigger.dev in order to set that up,
where we used Claude Code to actually
set up the code, and then we send it all
to a Clay webhook, so that we can
process everything appropriately, do all
of our AI ICP filtering, as well as our
AI message writing, and then push all of
those leads into the smart lead
campaigns. So, everything does its
enrichment and routing, and then we push
into our smart lead campaigns. Now, you
see that we have 50 different smart lead
campaigns. That's because each lead,
depending on their employee head count,
and depending on their job title, and
depending on what industry they're in,
they all go into a separate campaign,
which all gets completely routed. So, if
you wanted to see examples of this, I
already pulled this up, where we have
our Superbase in here, and you can see
at the bottom, we have over 5 million
records in here, which is just a crazy,
crazy amount of data. You'll see here,
this was a an important part, creating
this column here, we just call
processed, and that just tells us
whether or not we have processed this
lead on behalf of our customer or not,
because we don't want to retarget the
leads until we've really used the entire
list. So, we keep track of whether or
not we've targeted them yet, and if we
haven't, and then we use the processed
at time over here, and then you can see
the raw JSON of everything about them.
And then, I think for the YouTube video,
we're going to have to block the emails
for this, but then we're also keeping
track of what was the email source, who
do we have emails for that's validated,
when was the last time that they were
validated, etc., etc. And so, everything
gets organized in here. And so, then
what we set up with Cloud Code and
Trigger.dev is that it'll take the next
batch of leads that we need for the day,
and then it'll find any lead with client
ID, and if the processed is false, we
are going to push those leads 25 at a
time to a Clay webhook. As we push each
section of 25, we're going to change
processed from false to true, send over
the webhook, and then it gets processed
inside of Clay. And so, then this is the
Clay table that we use. I mean, it's got
100 columns, and it's just this
gigantic, crazy thing, where this is
just all the normal data, then we're
cleaning up the domain, the company,
we're enriching the for the LinkedIn
description here, we're doing last mile
email finding that we might not have
been able to do inside of Superbase,
just in case we need to find others. We
need to update their HubSpot every time
that we send an email, so we're doing
the HubSpot update, we're finding any
other company descriptions, and then
here is where we're starting to AI
generate the content where we're finding
their target customer. We're creating
some ideas, which is one of my favorite
campaigns. We're AI generating the first
line. There's only about three lines in
this email campaign. So, the first
line's generated, the second line is
generated, and then we have the CTA. And
then you can see this mess of the
numbers based on where they're supposed
to go, they get a number for the
campaign that they're supposed to be put
in. And then you can see we have all
these smart lead campaigns and
everything. And now, so the interesting
part is for most people, it really
doesn't have to get this crazy. This is
just at scale when you're sending tens
of thousands of emails a day, this is
how far you have to take it. But the
process is still the same. If you're
just watching this and you wanted to get
started, I still highly recommend the
same process. Pull your whole TAM, so
just you know exactly what you're
working with, and then you can enrich it
for any other things that you might need
with Claude code, or you can enrich it
in Clay and all those other things.
Then, when you find something that
works, we found 5% of our overall volume
we're testing things to see if we can
find anything that beats the baseline
strategy. But when you have these
campaigns that are winning campaigns and
you just need to keep pumping leads in,
I really like being able to have the
whole TAM, and then we know exactly how
much runway we have with all the emails
that we have, and then we push them into
Clay. Now, some of you might be asking,
"I've seen all these LinkedIn posts
about, you know, Clay is dead, and we
don't need Clay anymore because Claude
code can do everything, etc., etc." I've
found that it's incredibly pivotal to
still have Clay in the process because I
find that Claude is really good at doing
all of this like crazy new things
pulling the list and I can verify it. I
like using Claude for when I'm going to
do something one time and I'm doing this
big setup, I like using it then. I don't
really like trusting a routine or a
scheduled task inside of Claude code
that hopefully it's going to do it. I
like to see that trigger.dev is going to
work every day. I like to be able to see
inside of Clay that we received the
webhook, and then all of the AI is
working properly. And it's just on rails
versus if I was trying going things on
Claude code, it'd be hard to share it
with the team. You know, we lose the
observability per lead of what happened
with all of them. And so, I know a lot
of people are still trying to say this,
but we still process millions of rows
every week on behalf of our customers
through Clay, because I like doing all
of this big orchestration, getting the
emails done, and all those other things,
and then pumping it into Clay to do that
final mile of all the expensive things,
the AI-generated content, the first
lines, the ClayGens, and all those
things. We do those things right at the
end when we need to spend the money, and
then we push them into the SmartLead
campaigns. Now, you might be thinking
that system is crazy. Why does it matter
for me? This is cool, but I'm never
going to use this. And I think all the
principles still remain the same. We
still want to be able to get your whole
TAM together. We want to be able to
store that. We want to be able to do as
much of the enrichment as possible
before Clay, that's really
cost-effective. And then, anything that
we need as a last mile thing, the
AI-generated text and all those things,
we get done in Clay. This system is
still a system I would recommend for
everybody, even if you're only sending
500 to 1,000 emails a day. Just get your
whole TAM, so you know exactly what you
have. And then, you can push it into
Clay and automatically keep refilling
your campaigns. Before we had a system
like this, I literally had three
full-time people on my team downloading
CSVs from Apollo and uploading them into
Clay. And now that we can just do this
all on autopilot, we've gotten them to
do other things instead. But, being able
to take a winning campaign and not have
to think about it, where it just keeps
getting new leads every single day, is
absolutely a game-changer, and that's
the real takeaway that I want you to
learn, is using CloudCode, that once you
find that winner, you can keep pushing
more and more in every single day. So,
if you want a system like this set up
for your business, just use the link
below. Actually, the story with working
with Pathos is that the first campaign
that we launched for them, we actually
did for free, because we wanted to prove
that we genuinely would be able to get
them results. They passed our free test,
and now they've become one of our
favorite customers who is getting some
of the best results we've ever seen. And
so, if you'd like a system set up like
this for your business, there's a link
below where we will run a free campaign
for you, as well. And if you are a B2B
company doing over $3 million in
revenue, I'd love to launch a free
campaign for you. Thanks for watching.
